## OLD PROJECT - June 2020

### Please note that this is an older project, and my coding style and skills have evolved significantly since then. I encourage you to check out my more recent work by visiting [esteecodes.com](https://esteecodes.com) or [my GitHub](https://github.com/esteecodes).

# [Colmar Academy](https://estherwhitedev.github.io/Colmar-Academy/)

This project was originally completed in June 2020 as part of the **Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages** skill path by CodeCademy.

Long after completing the project, I moved it to this repository under my GitHub organization dedicated to projects featured in my YouTube videos. This move enhances both management and visibility.

Aside from moving the project and updating the README, the code has not been changed or maintained since the original completion date. A ZIP file of the original project is also included within this repository.

I have documented my workflow in the following videos:
